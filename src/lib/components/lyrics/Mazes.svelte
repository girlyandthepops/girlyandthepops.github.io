	twisted up in you
	<br />
	you made me such a fool again
	<br />
	still stuck on you
	<br />
	since i couldn’t be friends
	<br />
	<br />
	im not a game for you to play
	<br />
	still i couldn’t stay away
	<br />
	like some toxic haze
	<br />
	try to tell myself its just a phase
	<br />
	but
	<br />
	<br />
	i see replays
	<br />
	on long nights
	<br />
	fake love
	<br />
	post long fights
	<br />
	<br />
	the same scenes
	<br />
	in my mind
	<br />
	replaying
	<br />
	everytime
	<br />
	<br />
	‘cause im banging
	<br />
	left and rights round tight corners
	<br />
	looking for all the things i left with ya
	<br />
	and now the walls are closing in
	<br />
	and it seems like the same maze again
	<br />
	just a maze, aint it boy
	<br />
	just a game to you boy
	<br />
	<br />
	such a shame boy
	<br />
	its not the same boy
	<br />
	i know now, that you couldn’t go now
	<br />
	so ill stay here since you’ll need me
	<br />
	until you go and I’d know
	<br />
	what to do
	<br />
	if you said
	<br />
	what you felt
	<br />
	but I see
	<br />
	<br />
	i see replays
	<br />
	on long nights
	<br />
	real love
	<br />
	from your touch
	<br />
	<br />
	the same scenes
	<br />
	in my mind
	<br />
	replaying
	<br />
	everytime
	<br />
	<br />
	‘cause im banging
	<br />
	left and rights round tight corners
	<br />
	looking for all the things i left with ya
	<br />
	and now the walls are closing in
	<br />
	and it seems like the same maze again
	<br />
	just a maze, aint it boy
