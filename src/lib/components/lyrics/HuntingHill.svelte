<p class="typewriter">
	looking out over hunting hill
	<br />
	praying I could hold time still
	<br />
	long enough to catch my breath
	<br />
	long enough to find what’s left
	<br />
	<br />
	looking out over hunting hill
	<br />
	i saw you from the window sill
	<br />
	stood under a lone tree
	<br />
	watching the wind breath
	<br />
	<br />
	i made out your figure faintly
	<br />
	thought that you’d call me baby
	<br />
	but i know
	<br />
	white lines erased the charcoal
	<br />
	you gave me
	<br />
	<br />
	so erase me
	<br />
	just erase me
	<br />
	<br />
	race me up there
	<br />
	long strides
	<br />
	rip tides
	<br />
	pull me in
	<br />
	push me out
	<br />
	<br />
	see there’s sun coming through the window
	<br />
	i looked out to see ya
	<br />
	staring up at the sky
	<br />
	watching it all go by
	<br />
	<br />
	how could you know?
	<br />
	how could you look at me now and know?
	<br />
	<br />
	that this house is haunted
	<br />
	that hope hunted
	<br />
	and do you know
	<br />
	if im here alone?
	<br />
	or following blind
	<br />
	if there really is
	<br />
	one of a kind
	<br />
	one of your kind
	<br />
	But someone else is on your mind
	<br />
	<br />
	i made out your figure faintly
	<br />
	thought that you’d call me baby
	<br />
	but i know
	<br />
	white lines erased the charcoal
	<br />
	you gave me
	<br />
	<br />
	rip tides
	<br />
	pull me in
	<br />
	push me out
	<br />
	<br />
	go away now
	<br />
	gonna stay down
	<br />
	til I find out
	<br />
	that you looked away now
	<br />
	til im not here no more
	<br />
	til I can’t breathe no more
	<br />
	til you find me dead
	<br />
	off me head
	<br />
	half of the way down the stairs
