	scary thoughts running right through my mind
	<br />
	that shit you said to me is dumber than summer time
	<br />
	come down right here right now and put me in my place
	<br />
	i know someday somehow we will find a space
	<br />
	<br />
	‘cause
	<br />
	<br />
	something you said is in my head now
	<br />
	(V-E-R-A-N-O, so dumb)
	<br />
	sometimes I wish you wouldnt come around
	<br />
	(Cant see this being A-M-O-R)
	<br />
	all that shit you it’ll come back around
	<br />
	<br />
	something you said is in my head now
	<br />

	<br />

	<br />
	(Cant see this being A-M-O-R)
	<br />
	all that shit you it’ll come back around
	<br />
	<br />
	so don’t look at me, don’t wear my crown
	<br />
	you know my head is heavy and my neck is thin
	<br />
	and I tried not to smoke
	<br />
	but still took a toke and it took its toll
	<br />
	<br />
	that shit you said is dumber than summertime
	<br />
	dumber than that humid heat
	<br />
	those sticky seats
	<br />
	yhat right hand
	<br />
	reaching out to me
	<br />
	findind new ways to pretend
	<br />
	this will never come to an end
	<br />
	<br />

	dumber than summer
	<br />
	<br />
	dumber than that humid heat
	<br />
	those sticky seats
	<br />
	those long legs
	<br />
	walking back to me
	<br />
	finding new ways to pretend
	<br />
	this will never come to an end
	<br />
	<br />
	but summer’s over now
	<br />
	so you can spin me right round
	<br />
	way back to those old towns
	<br />
	summer’s over now
	<br />
