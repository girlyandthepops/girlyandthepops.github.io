	the old should’ve told you we were meant to be
	<br />
	but days far away now you lead me astray
	<br />
	on that last day
	<br />
	as ashes fell into the tray and now
	<br />
	red lights your eyes
	<br />
	as you park the car
	<br />
	for a walk in the park
	<br />
	to meet our friends
	<br />
	from years ago
	<br />
	you were across the room
	<br />
	i was halfway out the door
	<br />
	then you showed me
	<br />
	as we danced slowly
	<br />
	came closer one step at a time
	<br />
	you’d hold me
	<br />
	yeah you made yourself mine
	<br />
	and you told me as we danced slowly
	<br />
	<br />
	we took back roads
	<br />
	going back home
	<br />
	something to know
	<br />
	needed
	<br />
	someone to hold
	<br />
	should’ve grown old with you
	<br />
	i should’ve grown old with you
	<br />
	not a single thing left to do
	<br />
	<br />
	how could i have known
	<br />
	where else left to go
	<br />
	the way you looked you at me
	<br />

	how could i have known

	<br />

	how could i have known id be
