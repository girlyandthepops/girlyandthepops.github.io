	cigarette smoke on open skies
	<br />
	i’d make new clouds for you
	<br />
	spent long days, long gone
	<br />
	barely made it through
	<br />
	<br />
	mistakes i’ve made, thoughts i’ve had
	<br />
	you always said to think it through
	<br />
	still i’d only think of you
	<br />
	<br />
	i’m kissing curbs now
	<br />
	you shit my nerves now
	<br />
	was the lens always skewed?
	<br />
	still all I can see is you
	<br />
	<br />
	these days deranged
	<br />
	by last year’s games
	<br />
	spread thin across long lines
	<br />
	confined to the walls of my room
	<br />
	we spoke through telephone lines
	<br />
	you dialed me up & dialed me in
	<br />
	found yourself a way to win
	<br />
	more like something for me to lose
	<br />
	oh how could you make me choose?
	<br />
	what days to live
	<br />
	what to give
	<br />
	or who to save
	<br />
	i’m not that brave
	<br />
	im not
	<br />
	that
	<br />
	brave
	<br />
	<br />
	cause i see cigarette smoke on open skies
	<br />
	i’d make new clouds for you
	<br />
	spent long days, long gone
	<br />
	<br />
	said go to hell
	<br />
	but you could’ve wished
	<br />
	guess that’ll have to do
	<br />
	cause ill I can see is you
	<br />
	<br />
	was it denial?
	<br />
	cause you turned back after quarter a mile
	<br />
	then i saw
	<br />
	despair wear a veil so thin
	<br />
	over your smile
	<br />
	so i’ll try to be worth your while
	<br />
	so i’ll try to be worth your while
